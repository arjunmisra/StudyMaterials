Git Study Notes

git diff <commit id 1> <commit id 2>

git diff --staged // compares staging area files with the latest commit gi 

git diff file   // it compares the file in work directory and staging area

git log --stat // Gives info about the files also

git log --graph // Shows the log of the files




After a merge, the files from another branch lose thier parent. To compare the changes, use 

git show <commit id>

git merge branch1 branch2


git stash -- if you have unstaged changes in your branch and you want to merge changes from main repo, themn stash them and then later apply back.

git stash -- stashes the changes in local
git pull origin master
git stash show -- shows the changes in stash
git stash pop -- applies the changes in current branch
git stash drop -- drops the latest stash

git pull origin master = git fetch origin + git merge origin/master master

if you have made a commit in the github repo, then your origin is one commit ahead of your local. If there is a conflict like the current commit in both the repos(local and github) are different, then use - git fetch origin. This creates a separate branch and later you can merge them.

git pull upstream master 

This will pull all the changes in your local repo from the upstream.
